## INTRDUCTION

This project is a computer vision-based object tracking system built with OpenCV. Object tracking is an important component of many computer vision applications since it allows you to track the movement of specific objects across frames in pictures or movies. This project provides a foundation for several object tracking algorithms and shows how they can be used.

Algorithms used in this project are:
- CSRT
- BOOSTING
- MIL
- KCF
- TLD 
- MEDIANFLOW
- MOSSE


## Requirements
Before using this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pycharm
- OpenCV
- GPU (for high quality results)
Required Dependencies like : 

* opencv-Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* cvzone


## Customization
If you want to use a custom dataset or adapt the project for specific use cases, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your dataset with annotated object tracks (if necessary).

- Modify the project code to handle your specific data format, input source, or tracking criteria.

- Customize the tracking algorithm parameters to suit your application.

- Ensure that you document any changes or customizations in the project code.
## Performance
The project's performance may vary based on the chosen tracking algorithm, hardware, and input data characteristics. Make sure to evaluate and fine-tune the system for your specific use case to achieve the best results.
