<p id="description">This project is a computer vision-based object tracking system built with OpenCV. Object tracking is an important component of many computer vision applications since it allows you to track the movement of specific objects across frames in pictures or movies. This project provides a foundation for several object tracking algorithms and shows how they can be used.</p>
